This is a website prepared using machine learning model to predict Covid-19 cases
easily so that treatment can be made faster.

Idea:
Data can be collected on the symptoms of COVID-19
A machine learning model trained in such a way that it can predict if the patient has the probability of being affected by covid-19 or not.It can help to reduce people who will have to be tested.

Data
Since we donâ€™t have proper data available yet.Therefore, we will be using random data as of now. And in near future whenever we get proper data,to get proper result.

Machine Learning Model Parameters :

For now we will be taking into consideration the features that are being given by most doctors.

Features :                             Type of data
Fever                                  -Continuous
Body Pain	                             -True/False
Age		                                 -Numeric and discrete
Runny Nose                             -True/False
Difficulty Breathing                   -True/False
Travel History                         -True/False

Labels :
Probability of Covid-19

Tech Stack:
Bootstrap 
Flask 

Modules used:
Numpy
Sklearn
Pickle

Future Plans:
1-Presently Logistic Regression has been used.
In real life we'll try for all models and see  which model gives best results and depending on that we use the model
2-Real data can help in giving near to perfect predictions.
