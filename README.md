This is a website prepared using machine learning model to predict Covid-19 cases easily so that treatment can be made faster.

Idea:
Data can be collected on the symptoms of COVID-19
A machine learning model trained in such a way that it can predict if the patient has been affected by the coronavirus or not.
It can help to reduce people who will have to be tested.

Data
Since we don’t have proper data available yet. Therefore, we will be using random data as of now. And in near future whenever we get proper data, we will be using it for proper results.

Machine Learning Model Parameters :

A team of doctors can sit down to find out the correct features.
For now we will be taking into consideration the features that are being given by most doctors.

Features :                             Type of data
Fever                                  -Continuous
Body Pain	                             -0/1 Binary
Age		                                 - Discrete
Runny Nose                             -0/1 Binary
Difficulty Breathing –Categorical      -1/0/1 Binary

Labels :
Infection Probability of Covid-19


Tech Stack:
Bootstrap 
Flask 

Modules used:

Future Plans:
1-Presently Logistic Regression has been used.
In real life we'll try for all models and see  which model gives best results and depending on that we use the model
2-Real data can help in giving near to perfect predictions.
